## Jekyll is a bit of a Bitch to Set up

Hopefully it gets better after getting used to it.
The thing is the software updates and the instructions in the tutorials don't change. I got Ruby setup right and using the Gem thing and the bundle thing to do their stuff to have Jekyll installed. Then the first real test is to tell it to server the pages locally. Nothing happens and you have to delve into the error codes. Someone else will usually have had the same problem and probably got an answer on how to fix it.

So I found the fix and magically got the jekyll site up and running. I even got it published on GitHub pages
