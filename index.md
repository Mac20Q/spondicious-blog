## Welcome to Spondicious Blog

This is all about the trials and tribulations of setting this up with Jekyll. Getting to work locally was a pain due to changes in the code and the instructions not being updated. I finally managed to get it working and then found I could just set up a Jekyll blog on GitHub directly and clone the code down to my Mac.

I'm still a bit of a newbie with GitHub and wondered where the text was that was displayed on the page. Then I remembered to look in the other branches. It is the gh-pages branch supplying the data.

I added a post but it has not showed up yet on the web page. I'm doing this from the GitHub pages offering and I'll have to try out Netlify also to see if I can make it work.
